#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Forcefully kills every process from a unitree_go2_sim run (gz sim, ros2 launch,
# controller_manager/spawners, bridges, rviz, junior_ctrl).
#
# Why this exists: signals sent through screen/tmux/ros2-launch/shell-wrapper
# layers do not reliably reach the "gz sim server"/"gz sim gui" binaries at the
# bottom of that process chain -- a single `pkill -f "gz sim"` can silently miss
# them, especially the GUI process. A leftover gz sim server shares the same
# default gz-transport bus (GZ_PARTITION=hostname:user) as any new run, which is
# what causes symptoms like "the robot sometimes doesn't spawn" or a controller
# spawner that hangs waiting on a service. This script keeps re-checking and
# force-killing by PID until nothing matching is left, instead of trusting a
# single pattern-matched pkill pass.
#
# It also sweeps /dev/shm for orphaned FastDDS shared-memory segments
# (fastrtps_*) left behind by any ROS 2 process that was ever killed with
# SIGKILL instead of shutting down cleanly -- those don't get cleaned up by the
# OS, and a pile of them is a documented cause of ROS 2 nodes intermittently
# failing to discover/match each other (which looks exactly like "sometimes
# the robot spawns, sometimes it doesn't"). Only segments with no process
# still holding them open are removed, so this is safe to run even if other,
# unrelated ROS 2 work is active on the machine.
#
# Usage: ./clean_sim.sh [max_attempts]
